The solver 'eiquadprog.hpp' was taken here:
    http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~bstephe1/

It works on some of problems and fails on others. It seems that the solver has
a bug in handling of degenerate problems, see my comment near line 439. I don't
have time to debug it properly.

The usage is documented in 'eiquadprog.m'.
